This is a repository for storing all implementations of the same wave function from a Shaun Spalding's GameMaker Studio video in different programming languages.

When I watched that video I started to use that function a lot in my games, then started to implement it in other languages for other of my projects, and that ended up in this repository. ([See video here](https://youtu.be/2FroAhEsuE8?t=268))

See the original implementation (as of my knowledge): [main.gml](./languages/common/gml/main.gml) 

# Contributions
To contribute to this project your submission may accomplish the following requirements:
- The name of the file should be `main` if it's using the base language or a significative name if its using a framework. (f.e. [`unity.cs`](./languages/common/csharp/unity.cs))
- There should be a folder for every language submitted, and submissions should be in the correct folder.
- You should try to keep the script at a bare minimum, just the function and any additions that are **required** for it to work.
- Every submission here falls under _[Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/)_ license without exception. 

Also, normal language implementations should be under the folder [languages/common](./languages/common), any other language may go to [languages/misc](./languages/misc) (You may want to create it if is not already done...)

# Special Thanks
- The guy whoever made the original script <3
